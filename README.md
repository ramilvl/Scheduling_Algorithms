<h1> Scheduling_Algorithms </h1>
This project showcases the implementation of three different scheduling algorithms in Java: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms. These algorithms are widely used in operating systems to efficiently allocate resources and manage the execution of processes.
# Algorithms Implemented
* First Come First Serve (FCFS): The FCFS algorithm assigns resources to the processes in the order of their arrival. It follows a non-preemptive approach, allowing a process to complete its execution before moving on to the next process in the queue.

* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF): The SRTF algorithm is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that prioritizes processes based on their remaining execution time. It assigns resources to the process with the shortest remaining time, allowing new processes with shorter execution times to take precedence.

* Round Robin (RR): The RR algorithm allocates a fixed time slice or quantum to each process in a circular manner. It allows each process to execute for the quantum duration before moving on to the next process. If a process does not complete within the quantum, it is preempted and placed back in the queue to await its turn again.

# Usage
* Clone the repository or download the source code.
* Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
* Navigate to the directory where the source code is located.
* Explore the source code to understand the implementation of each scheduling algorithm.
* Run the Java file containing the main method, such as Main.java.

Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm <br>
Note: Round Robin scheduling algorithm uses different input. Arrival times should be same for round robin scheduling algorithm.
